AUTOEXEC REGROUPS AND EXPLAINS A BUNCH OF THIS STUFF, SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THAT FIRST.

I figured out a lot of this by digging through files extracted from the game.

Headache Folder: Too hard to explain everything in detail, and maybe to understand too. It took me hours to figure out this one script, hence the name. It's used to automatically equip & transfer your HCOG when swapping weapons, and to toggle automatically equipping & transfering your Digital Threat when swapping weapons. It's pretty ridiculous...
